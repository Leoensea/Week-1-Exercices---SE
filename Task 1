### Task 1: What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes? 

Actions I have done to fortify my defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes : 
- use a complicated password with special characters
- use a different password for each account
- change my passwords quite frequently
- whenever possible, I use 2-factor authentication
- I check the sender's information of financial mails

Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example phishing and malware attacks. 
What could you improve on?

One day I received a text message containing a suspicious link. I clicked on it and I was charged a few euros by my telephone operator. 
Since then, I have blocked additional expenses with my telephone operator and I am always vigilant about the emails I receive.
